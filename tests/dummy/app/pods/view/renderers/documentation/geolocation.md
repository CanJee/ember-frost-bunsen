## geolocation

This renders an address input with geolocation lookup support. This renderer
uses MapQuest's geolocation services under the hood. In order to leverage this
functionality your Ember application will need to configure a MapQuest API key
in it's environment or directly in the bunsen view itself. In order to configure
this API key once for your entire app you'll need to add the following to your
environment configuration (`config/environment.js`):

```js
module.exports = function (environment) {
  var ENV = {
    // The rest of your configuration goes hereâ€¦
    'ember-frost-bunsen': {
      MAPQUEST_API_KEY: process.env.MAPQUEST_API_KEY
    }
  }
```

> Note: You can get a developer API key [here](https://developer.mapquest.com/).


### Properties

#### label

```json
{
  "label": "Bar",
  "model": "foo",
  "renderer": {
    "name": "geolocation"
  }
}
```

#### renderer.apiKey

If you choose not to set the API key for the entire app, you can pass it
directly in your view with this property.

```json
{
  "model": "foo",
  "renderer": {
    "apiKey": "<your-api-key-goes-here>",
    "name": "geolocation"
  }
}
```

#### renderer.refs

This property block lets you map the inputs in this custom renderer to
properties in your bunsen model. The idea is that you point the custom renderer
to an object in your bunsen model that contains sub-properties for whatever
address fields you care about. Below is an example of all inputs being mapped
but you are free to map a subset of these as well as name your mapped properties
whatever you want. The mapped properties that you can use different names for
are the the values in the value, i.e. `${./address}` could be `${./street}`.

```json
{
  "model": "address",
  "renderer": {
    "name": "geolocation",
    "refs": {
      "address": "${./address}",
      "city": "${./city}",
      "country": "${./country}",
      "latitude": "${./latitude}",
      "longitude": "${./longitude}",
      "postalCode": "${./postalCode}",
      "state": "${./state}"
    }
  }
}
```
